    <h1>About DevOps</h1>
    <p>DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the system development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.</p>
    <p>The core concepts of DevOps include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Breaking down silos between development and operations teams.</li>
        <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Streamlining processes through automation to reduce manual effort.</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> Regularly measuring performance and iterating on processes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>History of DevOps</h2>
    <p>DevOps emerged as a response to the challenges faced by traditional software development and IT operations. By integrating these two functions, organizations can improve communication, increase agility, and deliver better software faster.</p>
    <h2>Benefits of DevOps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Move at high velocity to innovate for customers faster.</li>
